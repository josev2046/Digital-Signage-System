This repository outlines the development of a simple digital signage solution, leveraging a Raspberry Pi and the Vimeo API. Designed for dynamic art installations or informational displays, the system automates the daily refresh of video content: initiating a morning cycle to cease any ongoing playback, purge previous media, procure the latest video asset from a specified Vimeo source, and then commence continuous, hardware-accelerated playback until the subsequent daily refresh.
